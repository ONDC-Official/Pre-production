Plus, soy protein provides a good source of energy from calories and branched-chain amino acids. When combined with exercise and a healthy diet, soy protein makes an excellent “partner” in a successful diet plan. For fighting fat, you just can’t beat soybeans for their versatility. Though surprisingly high in fat for a bean, it’s mostly the healthy unsaturated kind. A significant number of research studies support claims that soy protein can help you lose weight. Infused with the goodness of Soy Protein, the VLCC Waist and Tummy Trim Gel gets absorbed quickly and helps you achieve a slimmer, toned and firm waist and tummy.",

With added UVA/UVB sunscreens, this moisturizer with SPF and PA also provides protection against UV rays. With added Vitamin B3, it also helps strengthen the skin’s protective barrier. In addition, it also contains Vitamin E acetate that uses its anti-oxidant power to protect skin cells from foreign threats. Use this anti-aging moisturizer for youthfully radiant skin. Simply apply every day after cleansing for skin that’s moisturized and smooth.\"",

										"long_desc": "\"The best defence against any vaginal discomfort is prevention. Protect your most delicate area with daily use of a special product – VWash PLUS. With a pH of 3.5, V Wash restores pH in the intimate area and helps to prevent irritation, itching and dryness in the intimate area.\nThe vagina has a natural protective layer which is acidic in nature, to help prevent infection. This layer is maintained when good bacteria called lactobacilli produce Lactic acid , which maintains the acidic environment at a pH value of 3.5 to 4.5. This promotes the growth of lactobacilli, inhibiting the presence of harmful bacteria and preventing infection. A healthy vaginal flora requires a pH of 3.5 - 4.5. Most soaps are alkaline in nature which have a pH value of 8 & above. The daily use of soap to cleanse the vaginal area may upsets ideal pH balance of the vagina. This may leads to vaginal discomforts like dryness, irritation & itching and could eventually lead to vaginal infections.\nVWash PLUS has lactic acid which restores vaginal pH balance and is enriched with sea buckthorn oil which contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants & amino acids. Daily washing with VWash PLUS leaves a fresh sensation & maintains healthy vaginal flora. It also helps prevent unpleasant odour & irritation in the intimate area.It is safe for daily use. It is Paraben & SLS/SLES free. VWash Plus is usable during periods as well.\nNow don’t just wash, VWash PLUS.\"",

Lipton flavours some of its teas with added natural flavours and no artificial flavours are used.

										"long_desc": "Tired of frizz that leaves your hair looking unmanageable and dry? Does tangled hair lead to hair breakage, hair fall? Look no further. Everyday damage can stress strands, leaving them prone to breakage and hair fall. Presenting New Dove Healthy Ritual for Growing Hair Conditioner is inspired by the rituals of North American women. The ritual uses natural ingredients like cone flower, oil and white tea which are known de-stressors, to nourish hair and help it reach its natural growth potential by keeping it healthy and long. Dove borrowed this healthy ritual and created the new Healthy Ritual for Growing Hair. Combined with the superior care of Dove, the formula instantly smoothens out the hair surface, preventing frizz and keeps hair looking smooth and shiny. It works to reduce frizz, making hair appear smooth and controls fly away hair. Due to strands being smooth, they detangle easily, minimising breakage and letting your hair look long and smooth. Dove believes hair can look good at any length, as long as it is properly cared for. So give your hair the love it deserves.

										"long_desc": "\"Silk is a natural microfiber, enveloped in the warmth of cocoon during its nascent stage. Its amino acid composition is close to that of human skin and when the silk fiber comes in contact with water, it becomes ultra-sensitive to abrasion. Just like how chemicals can react on our skin and prove to be harmful, similarly, regular detergents can make these silk fabrics look chaffed, brittle and as if covered with white residue. Love & Care is an expert range of fabric wash designed to take care of your special clothes, it is a pH balanced formula which is designed to be gentle on silk and retains shine unlike regular detergents. The expert care liquid detergent is crafted with No Enzymes and No Bleach which maintains the strength and colour of the fabric. The next time you flaunt your chanderi silk kurta, mysore silk sari or banarasi dupatta with zari work remember to care for it as well with a gentle hand wash of Love & Care. It maintains the flowiness of Chiffons, cares for the drapes on Crepe and gives an overall bouncy look to Georgettes. The Love & Care range is recommended by India’s leading fashion designer Manish Malhotra who is an expert in fabrics and fashion. Love & Care is a brand of Hindustan Unilever Limited.\"\nAuthentic wool is made of a protein called keratin which is also responsible for keeping our hair follicles healthy and nourished. Most detergents contain chemicals like enzymes which are extremely harsh on delicate woollen wear, making them weakened, mis-shaped, cause holes in them and also takes away their natural softness. Love & Care is carefully designed with pH neutral formula – thereby maintaining its softness and lustre. It keeps your precious woollens looking newer for much longer. The Soft Woollens variant is specially designed to be extremely mild on your soft woollen clothes. The liquid detergent is designed to be pH neutral that keep the strength of the wool intact. The No Enzymes and No Bleach formula cares for delicate fibres, prevents shrinkage of your woollens and retains new like shine. The low foaming formula also avoids over rinsing and prevents shrinkage of your woollen wear, keeps it looking new. The next time you flaunt your beautiful woollen sweater remember to care for it as well with a gentle hand wash of Love & Care.

										"long_desc": "\"The best defence against any vaginal discomfort is prevention. Protect your most delicate area with daily use of a special product – VWash PLUS. With a pH of 3.5, V Wash restores pH in the intimate area and helps to prevent irritation, itching and dryness in the intimate area.\nThe vagina has a natural protective layer which is acidic in nature, to help prevent infection. This layer is maintained when good bacteria called lactobacilli produce Lactic acid , which maintains the acidic environment at a pH value of 3.5 to 4.5. This promotes the growth of lactobacilli, inhibiting the presence of harmful bacteria and preventing infection. A healthy vaginal flora requires a pH of 3.5 - 4.5. Most soaps are alkaline in nature which have a pH value of 8 & above. The daily use of soap to cleanse the vaginal area may upsets ideal pH balance of the vagina. This may leads to vaginal discomforts like dryness, irritation & itching and could eventually lead to vaginal infections.\nVWash PLUS has lactic acid which restores vaginal pH balance and is enriched with sea buckthorn oil which contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants & amino acids. Daily washing with VWash PLUS leaves a fresh sensation & maintains healthy vaginal flora. It also helps prevent unpleasant odour & irritation in the intimate area.It is safe for daily use. It is Paraben & SLS/SLES free. VWash Plus is usable during periods as well.\nNow don’t just wash, VWash PLUS.\"",

										"long_desc": "\"The best defence against any vaginal discomfort is prevention. Protect your most delicate area with daily use of a special product – VWash PLUS. With a pH of 3.5, V Wash restores pH in the intimate area and helps to prevent irritation, itching and dryness in the intimate area.\nThe vagina has a natural protective layer which is acidic in nature, to help prevent infection. This layer is maintained when good bacteria called lactobacilli produce Lactic acid , which maintains the acidic environment at a pH value of 3.5 to 4.5. This promotes the growth of lactobacilli, inhibiting the presence of harmful bacteria and preventing infection. A healthy vaginal flora requires a pH of 3.5 - 4.5. Most soaps are alkaline in nature which have a pH value of 8 & above. The daily use of soap to cleanse the vaginal area may upsets ideal pH balance of the vagina. This may leads to vaginal discomforts like dryness, irritation & itching and could eventually lead to vaginal infections.\nVWash PLUS has lactic acid which restores vaginal pH balance and is enriched with sea buckthorn oil which contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants & amino acids. Daily washing with VWash PLUS leaves a fresh sensation & maintains healthy vaginal flora. It also helps prevent unpleasant odour & irritation in the intimate area.It is safe for daily use. It is Paraben & SLS/SLES free. VWash Plus is usable during periods as well.\nNow don’t just wash, VWash PLUS.\"",

Lipton flavours some of its teas with added natural flavours and no artificial flavours are used.

										"long_desc": "\"Polident Denture fixative cream is an adhesive or glue which holds dentures in place and seals out food particles from getting stuck beneath dentures.\nIt is suitable for everyone who wears a partial or full denture, and is worried about his / her denture movement or food particles getting stuck between gums & dentures. The formulation doesn't contain zinc, artificial flavors or colors - thereby does not interfere with the taste of your favorite foods. The product enhances denture fit & comfort, and works all day to help protect gums from irritation.\nThe cream contains two adhesive polymers which absorb saliva and expand. As they expand, they interlock creating a soft and flexible 3-dimensional structure between your denture and gum tissue. This significantly increases surface coverage, creating a seal to help keep out food particles and provide a firm lasting hold. Because your dentures stay in place all day long, you need not worry about your dentures and can live a confident life - by enjoying your favorite foods, laughing out loud, singing or speaking confidently and getting close to your loved ones.\nPolident Denture Fixative / Adhesive Cream is available in 20g pack. Always follow instructions and guidance included on the pack before use.\"\nPolident Denture Fixative Cream provides strong, all day hold for dentures\nAdhesive cream forms a protective seal to prevent irritating food particles from getting stuck between dentures & gums\nDoesn't contain zinc - Polident is suitable for daily use.\nDesigned with no artificial colors or flavors - hence does not interfere with the taste of your favorite foods\nFrom World's Number 1 Denture Care brand\nSuitable for both partial and complete / full dentures",
